# Billie

Welcome to Billie! We (Charlie Barrett, Erika Clark-Gould,  Hanna Elszasz, Ryan Guarino, and Celine Tao) originally created this game as a semester long project in Christopher Weaver's Computational Media: Videogame Design and Development class. Intended to teach 2nd through 5th graders some of the basics of the engineering concept of simple machines, Billie delighted the kids of MacDonough Elementary school and went on to win "Best Game" and "Best Implementation of Concept" over the other three group by a panel of Wesleyan University professors and industry professionals.
